This copy of googletest-1.10.0 is a modified version of the original.

The following changes have been made to the original:

- Disabled INSTALL() rules.

- Forced static library builds.

- Disabled some options for enabling unit tests and other
  settings that aren't necessary for rom-properties.

- cmake_minimum_required() is disabled, since it interfered with
  policies set by the main build infrastructure.

- Removed test suites, scripts, and Xcode projects in order to reduce
  warnings on LGTM.

- Disabled [[noreturn]] and constexpr on MSVC 2013 and earlier.
