version to 10.1.0

Tag: 10.1.0

The following changes have been made to the original:

- Parts of the original CMakeLists.txt that were not necessary for
  rom-properties have been disabled, including the test suite.

- Test cases are no longer built and run.

- cmake_minimum_required() is disabled, since it interfered with
  policies set by the main build infrastructure.

- Fixed several -Wformat warnings.
