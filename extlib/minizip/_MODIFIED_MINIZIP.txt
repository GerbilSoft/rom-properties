commit 2aa369c468aa1d931c52ff7dc3da962b71a94118
Version 2.9.3.

Tag: 2.9.3

The following changes have been made to the original:

- cmake_minimum_required() has been disabled. The project-wide values
  will be used instead.

- Certain compile definitions are exported as part of the libminizip
  target, since they're needed in order to prevent build errors in
  other projects.

- mz_os_win32.c: #define FSCTL_GET_REPARSE_POINT if it isn't defined.

- Some other functionality not needed by rom-properties has been disabled.
