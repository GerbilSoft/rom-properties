commit 2cbffcdb476d7ef12b29a635aed37a221fc3945d
Fix BUILD_BYPRODUCTS argument for zlib

Tag: 2.8.9 (+1 commit)

The following changes have been made to the original:

- cmake_minimum_required() has been disabled. The project-wide values
  will be used instead.

- Certain compile definitions are exported as part of the libminizip
  target, since they're needed in order to prevent build errors in
  other projects.

- Some other functionality not needed by rom-properties has been disabled.
