This copy of rapidjson-1.1.0 is a modified version of the original.

The following changes have been made to the original:

- Disabled INSTALL() rules.

- Disabled ccache.

- Disabled some options for enabling unit tests and other
  settings that aren't necessary for rom-properties.

- cmake_minimum_required() is disabled, since it interfered with
  policies set by the main build infrastructure.

- Removed examples, test suites, and test data.

- Removed jsonchecker, which uses the JSON license.
