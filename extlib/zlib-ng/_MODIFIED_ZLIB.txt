This copy of zlib-ng 2.1.5 is a modified version of the original.

commit 2bc66887ddc0c50776811a27be68e34430d665e1
2.1.5 Release
    
Tag: 2.1.5

The following changes have been made to the original:

- CMakeLists.txt has been edited to prevent building the Win32 resource
  data when being built as a shared library.

- Example binaries are no longer built. (Removed the entire test/ directory.)

- CMakeLists.txt now sets the target compile definitions to -DZLIB_CONST
  and sets the target include directories. This allows all targets
  that depend on zlib/zlibstatic to automatically pick up the compile
  definitions and include directories.

- cmake_minimum_required() is disabled, since it interfered with
  policies set by the main build infrastructure.

- C17 has been added to the allowed standards list.

- Disabled CPack.

- Disable TLS when building for Windows on i386. Windows XP has problems with it.

- Some other functionality not needed by rom-properties has been disabled.
