This copy of minizip-ng 4.0.0 is a modified version of the original.

commit a1f568d60135079881ef2be08d1758013ebbb542
Version 4.0.0.

Tag: 4.0.0

The following changes have been made to the original:

- cmake_minimum_required() has been disabled. The project-wide values
  will be used instead.

- Certain compile definitions are exported as part of the libminizip
  target, since they're needed in order to prevent build errors in
  other projects.

- mz_os_win32.c: #define FSCTL_GET_REPARSE_POINT if it isn't defined.

- Fixed a -Wformat warning.

- Some other functionality not needed by rom-properties has been disabled.
