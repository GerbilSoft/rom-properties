This copy of minizip-ng 3.0.10 is a modified version of the original.

commit 8d2488c481ca665f26a8b186ca9e3bcb79ba6e0b
Version 3.0.10.

Tag: 3.0.10

The following changes have been made to the original:

- cmake_minimum_required() has been disabled. The project-wide values
  will be used instead.

- Certain compile definitions are exported as part of the libminizip
  target, since they're needed in order to prevent build errors in
  other projects.

- mz_os_win32.c: #define FSCTL_GET_REPARSE_POINT if it isn't defined.

- Fixed a -Wformat warning.

- Some other functionality not needed by rom-properties has been disabled.
