This copy of minizip-ng 4.0.7 is a modified version of the original.

commit fe5fedc365f7824ada0cf9a84fb79b30d5fc97a8
Version 4.0.7.

Tag: 4.0.7

The following changes have been made to the original:

- cmake_minimum_required() has been disabled. The project-wide values
  will be used instead.

- Certain compile definitions are exported as part of the libminizip
  target, since they're needed in order to prevent build errors in
  other projects.

- mz_os_win32.c: #define FSCTL_GET_REPARSE_POINT if it isn't defined.

- Fixed a -Wformat warning.

- Some other functionality not needed by rom-properties has been disabled.

- project(): Disabled DESCRIPTION and HOMEPAGE_URL due to requiring
  newer versions of CMake than what's available in Ubuntu 16.04.

- Commit e6eeb4ea520915a762d2c317d0a7ad552a89de04 has been cherry-picked
  from the develop branch. This commit slightly reduces memory usage on
  64-bit systems. (not including the mz_crypt_openssl.c change because
  it doesn't apply here)
