This copy of minizip-ng 4.0.9 is a modified version of the original.

commit 95ba7abdd24a956bde584db54d1d55e37d511e2f
Version 4.0.9.

Tag: 4.0.9

The following changes have been made to the original:

- cmake_minimum_required() has been disabled. The project-wide values
  will be used instead.

- Certain compile definitions are exported as part of the libminizip
  target, since they're needed in order to prevent build errors in
  other projects.

- mz_os_win32.c: #define FSCTL_GET_REPARSE_POINT if it isn't defined.

- Fixed a -Wformat warning.

- Some other functionality not needed by rom-properties has been disabled.

- project(): Disabled DESCRIPTION and HOMEPAGE_URL due to requiring
  newer versions of CMake than what's available in Ubuntu 16.04.
