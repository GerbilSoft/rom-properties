This copy of uniwidth is a modified subset of gnulib.

commit c63a0c677c1d032cde39bb84205ac3f92b1eb494
Update to Unicode 17.0.0.

The following changes have been made to the original:

- Only the uniwidth subset is included.

- A CMake build system has been added.

- .in.h files have been changed to .h.

- CJK encoding checks have been removed, since we're only
  using UTF-8.
