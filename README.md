# ROM Properties Page shell extension

This shell extension adds a few nice features to file browsers for managing
video game ROM and disc images.

## v2.1

![Right-click menu in Thunar showing the "Convert to PNG" option](doc/img/rp-v2.1-thunar.ConvertToPNG.png)

Major changes in v2.1 include:

* Support for GTK4 UI frontends, e.g. Nautilus 43. Note that Nautilus 43 has
  significantly limited the functionality of property pages, so it's only
  partially implemented at the moment.

* Right-click menu option for "Convert to PNG" for supported texture files,
  e.g. DDS and KTX.

* rp-config now has a built-in update checker on the "About" tab.

* KTX2: RG88 texture format and swizzling are now supported.

Translators needed; file an issue if you'd like to get started on a new
translation, or submit a Pull Request if you have a translation ready to go.

See [`NEWS.md`](NEWS.md) for a full list of changes in v2.1.

## Feedback

This is a work in progress; feedback is encouraged. To leave feedback, you
can file an issue on GitHub, or visit the Gens/GS IRC channel:

## Installation

Currently, the ROM Properties Page shell extension is compatible with the
following platforms:
* KDE Frameworks 5.x
* XFCE (GTK+ 2.x, GTK+ 3.x)
* GNOME and Unity (GTK+ 3.x)
* MATE Desktop (1.18+; GTK+ 3.x)
* Cinnamon Desktop
* Windows 7 (and later)

The following platforms are still compatible, but may not receive as much support:
* KDE 4.x
* Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, Windows Vista

On Windows Vista and later, you will need the MSVC 2015-2022 runtime:
* 32-bit: https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/VC_redist.x86.exe
* 64-bit: https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/VC_redist.x64.exe

On Windows XP/2003 and earlier, you will need the MSVC 2015-2017 runtime:
* 32-bit: https://aka.ms/vs/15/release/VC_redist.x86.exe
* 64-bit: https://aka.ms/vs/15/release/VC_redist.x64.exe

For instructions on compiling from source, see [`doc/COMPILING.md`](doc/COMPILING.md).

### Linux

Install the relevant .deb package, depending on what desktop environment you
are using and what your CPU is.

After installing, the plugin needs to be enabled in the Dolphin file browser:
* Close all instances of Dolphin.
* Start Dolphin.
* Click Control, Configure Dolphin.
* Click the "General" section, then the "Preview" tab.
* Check the "ROM Properties Page" item, then click OK.
* Enable previews in a directory containing a supported file type.

If installed correctly, thumbnails should be generated for the supported
file type. You can also right-click a file, select Properties, then click
the "ROM Properties" tab to view more information about the ROM image.

### Windows

Extract the ZIP archive to a directory, then run install.exe. The installer
requires administrator access, so click "Yes" if requested. In the installer,
click the "Install" button to register the ROM Properties Page DLL.

Note that this will hard-code the location of the DLL files in the registry,
so you may want to place the DLLs in a common location.

To uninstall the plugin, run install.exe again, then click the "Uninstall"
button.

Notes:
* Internal image refers to artwork contained within the ROM and/or disc image.
  These images are typically displayed on the system's main menu prior to
  starting the game.
  * "N/A" here means the ROM or disc image doesn't have this feature.
  * "No" indicates that the feature is present but not currently implemented.
* External scans refers to scans from an external database, such as GameTDB.com
  for GameCube and Wii.
  * "No" indicates no database is currently available for this system.
  * Anything else indicates what types of images are available.
  * For amiibo, "media" refers to the amiibo object, which may be a figurine,
    a card, or a plush.
* Windows executables may contain multiple icon sizes. Support for Windows icons
  will be added once support for multiple image sizes is added.
* Sega 8-bit only supports ROM images with a "TMR SEGA" header.

An initial configuration program is included with the Windows version of
rom-propreties 1.0. This allows you to configure which images will be used for
thumbnails on each system. The functionality is available on Linux as well, but
the UI hasn't been ported over yet. See `doc/rom-properties.conf.example` for
an example configuration file, which can be placed in `~/.config/rom-properties`.

## External Media Downloads

Certain parsers support the use of external media scans through an online
database, e.g. GameTDB.com. This is enabled by default, but you can customize
which scans are downloaded for which systems by running the configuration
program, `rp-config.exe`.

Downloaded images are cached to the following directory:
* Linux: `~/.cache/rom-properties/`
* Windows XP: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\rom-properties\cache`
* Windows Vista+: `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\LocalLow\rom-properties\cache`

The directory structure matches the source site, so e.g. a disc image of
Super Smash Bros. Brawl would be downloaded to
`~/.cache/rom-properties/wii/disc/US/RSBE01.png`. Note that if the download
fails for any reason, a 0-byte dummy file will be placed in the cache,
which tells the shell extension not to attempt to download the file again.
[FIXME: If the download fails due to no network connectivity, it shouldn't
do this.]

If you have an offline copy of the GameTDB image database, you can copy
it to the ROM Properties Page cache directory to allow the extension to
use the pre-downloaded version instead of downloading images as needed.

## Decryption Keys

Some newer formats, including Wii disc images, have encrypted sections. The
shell extension includes decryption code for handling these images, but the
keys are not included. To install the keys, create a text file called
`keys.conf` in the rom-properties configuration directory:

* Linux: `~/.config/rom-properties/keys.conf`
* Windows: `%APPDATA%\rom-properties\keys.conf`

The `keys.conf` file uses INI format. An example file, `keys.conf.example`,
is included with the shell extension. This file has a list of all supported
keys, with placeholders instead of the actual key data. For example, a
`keys.conf` file with the supported keys for Wii looks like this:

```
[Keys]
rvl-common=[Wii common key]
rvl-korean=[Wii Korean key]
```

Replace the key placeholders with hexadecimal strings representing the key.
In this example, both keys are AES-128, so the hexadecimal strings should be
32 characters long.

NOTE: If a key is incorrect, any properties dialog that uses the key to
decrypt data will show an error message instead of the data in question.

### Nintendo DS Secure Area

To encrypt or decrypt the Nintendo DS Secure Area, the Blowfish key must be
named `nds-blowfish.bin` and placed in the same directory as `keys.conf`.

## Unsupported File?

If you have a file that you believe should be supported by ROM Propeties, or
would like to see support added for a new type, file an issue on GitHub:
