 1. We don't promise that this software works.  (But if you find any bugs,
    please let us know!)
 2. You can use this software for whatever you want.  You don't have to pay us.
 3. You may not pretend that you wrote this software.  If you use it in a
    program, you must acknowledge somewhere in your documentation that
    you've used the IJG code.

 The authors make NO WARRANTY or representation, either express or implied,

 Permission is hereby granted to use, copy, modify, and distribute this
 software (or portions thereof) for any purpose, without fee, subject to these
 conditions:
 (1) If any part of the source code for this software is distributed, then this
 README file must be included, with this copyright and no-warranty notice
 unaltered; and any additions, deletions, or changes to the original files
 must be clearly indicated in accompanying documentation.
 (2) If only executable code is distributed, then the accompanying
 documentation must state that "this software is based in part on the work of
 the Independent JPEG Group".
 (3) Permission for use of this software is granted only if the user accepts
 full responsibility for any undesirable consequences; the authors accept
 NO LIABILITY for damages of any kind.
 .
 These conditions apply to any software derived from or based on the IJG code,
 not just to the unmodified library.  If you use our work, you ought to
 acknowledge us.

 Permission is NOT granted for the use of any IJG author's name or company name

 ansi2knr.c is included in this distribution by permission of L. Peter Deutsch,
 sole proprietor of its copyright holder, Aladdin Enterprises of Menlo Park, CA.
 ansi2knr.c is NOT covered by the above copyright and conditions, but instead
 by the usual distribution terms of the Free Software Foundation; principally,
 that you must include source code if you redistribute it.  (See the file
 ansi2knr.c for full details.)  However, since ansi2knr.c is not needed as part
 of any program generated from the IJG code, this does not limit you more than
 the foregoing paragraphs do.
 .
 The Unix configuration script "configure" was produced with GNU Autoconf.
 It is copyright by the Free Software Foundation but is freely distributable.
 The same holds for its supporting scripts (config.guess, config.sub,
 ltmain.sh).  Another support script, install-sh, is copyright by X Consortium
 but is also freely distributable.
 .
 The IJG distribution formerly included code to read and write GIF files.
 To avoid entanglement with the Unisys LZW patent, GIF reading support has
 been removed altogether, and the GIF writer has been simplified to produce
 "uncompressed GIFs".  This technique does not use the LZW algorithm; the
 resulting GIF files are larger than usual, but are readable by all standard
 GIF decoders.
 .
 We are required to state that
     "The Graphics Interchange Format(c) is the Copyright property of
     CompuServe Incorporated.  GIF(sm) is a Service Mark property of
     CompuServe Incorporated."
